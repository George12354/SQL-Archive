##  Project Overview

This project leverages SQL Server to analyze a hospital management database, aiming to:

- Evaluate **doctor performance** by appointment volume and consultation fees.
- Identify **appointment patterns**, including monthly trends and cancellation rates.
- Examine **patient demographics**, such as average age and booking behavior.
- Analyze **treatment data** to uncover common diagnoses and prescribed medications.

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **SQL Server** (or Azure SQL Database)
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or **Azure Data Studio**
- **Power BI** or **Tableau** (optional, for visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sai-forge/hospital-sql-project.git
   cd hospital-sql-project

2. Import the dataset:

   * Open SSMS/Azure Data Studio
   * Import `hospital_management_dataset.xlsx` into a new database
3. Execute the SQL script:

   ```sql
   -- Run all queries
   :r HOSPITAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM_SQL_PROJECT.sql
   ```

## ðŸ—‚ DATASET SCHEMA

## ðŸ’¡ SQL Queries & Insights

### Doctor Performance

Retrieve the top doctor by total appointments handled (completed or scheduled):

```sql
WITH ranked_doctors AS (
  SELECT
    d.doctor_id,
    d.first_name,
    COUNT(*) AS appointment_count,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
  FROM Doctors d
  JOIN Appointments a ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
  WHERE a.status IN ('Completed', 'Scheduled')
  GROUP BY d.doctor_id, d.first_name
)
SELECT first_name, appointment_count
FROM ranked_doctors
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### Appointment Trends

Analyze monthly booking volumes to spot seasonal patterns:

```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(appointment_date) AS year,
  MONTH(appointment_date) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_appointments
FROM Appointments
WHERE status IN ('Completed', 'Scheduled')
GROUP BY YEAR(appointment_date), MONTH(appointment_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### Patient Demographics

Calculate the average age of patients:

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, date_of_birth, GETDATE())) AS average_age
FROM Patients;
```

### Treatment Analytics

Identify the most common diagnosis-medication combinations:

```sql
SELECT
  diagnosis,
  prescribed_medication,
  COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM Treatments
GROUP BY diagnosis, prescribed_medication
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
```

## Final Result

1. **Doctor Performance:**

   * Top performer: Dr. Heather White (15 appointments).
   * Cardiology leads in total visits.
2. **Appointment Trends:**

   * Peak booking hours: 2â€“4 PM.
   * Cancellation rate: 12.5%.
3. **Patient Demographics:**

   * Average age: 47 years.
   * Advance bookings (â‰¥7 days): 65%.
4. **Treatment Insights:**

   * Leading diagnosis: "Evening point job ready clear majority" (placeholder).
   * Most prescribed medication: "skin" (placeholder).
